# GlobalWaves Project

## Overview
**GlobalWaves** is a simulated music streaming platform that evolves  
through several stages, each adding new features to create a dynamic  
user experience. The project mirrors real-world streaming services,  
incorporating playlists, recommendations, user interactions, and  
artist monetization. The system is scalable and user-friendly,  
focusing on smooth transitions between features as users interact  
with music content.

## Project Flow

### Stage 1: Building the Foundations
The first phase focused on creating the core structure of the platform.  
We started by building basic functionality to manage users, playlists,  
and songs. This set the stage for user commands, allowing interactions  
such as searching for content, following playlists, and liking songs.  
The foundation laid here ensured that the system could later expand  
without major structural changes.

### Stage 2: Expanding User Interactions
In the second phase, the project expanded to include more detailed user  
roles, such as normal users, artists, and hosts. Pagination was  
introduced to handle large amounts of content, ensuring smooth  
navigation. This stage also added functionality to delete users, with  
special care to manage dependencies, such as whether other users were  
actively engaging with their content. With these enhancements,  
**GlobalWaves** became more interactive, with artists and hosts able to  
manage albums and podcasts, while users could explore more content.

### Stage 3: Analytics and Recommendations
The final phase introduced analytics and personalized recommendations.  
Notifications were added, allowing users to stay updated on their  
favorite artists or hosts, while recommendation algorithms provided  
tailored content based on listening history. Monetization was also  
implemented, rewarding artists based on user activity. This stage  
pulled everything together, creating a platform that adapts to user  
preferences and provides real-time insights for artists.

## Final Thoughts
**GlobalWaves** offers a rich user experience by integrating key  
streaming service features over multiple stages of development. While  
challenging at times, each phase of the project contributed to a deeper  
understanding of user management, system design, and how to create a  
personalized, scalable platform.
